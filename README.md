## Projects Developed: 

1. **<ins>Project 1: Build My World</ins>** - Developed a custom simulation environment with multiple robot models and wrote a C++ world plugin to interact with our world.

2. **<ins>Project 2: Go Chase It</ins>** - Designed a mobile robot and housed it inside a gazebo world, programmed the robot with C++ nodes to chase white coloured balls.

3. **<ins>Project 3 :Where Am I</ins>** -  Successfuly localized our robot using Adaptive Monte Carlo Localization, also learned about the various algorithms like Kalaman filters and EKF.

4. **<ins>Project 4 : Map My world</ins>** - Created a 2D occupancy grid and 3D octomap from a simulated environment using our own robot with the RTAB-Map package.
